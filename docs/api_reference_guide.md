# Tax Law Reasoning Generator API Documentation

## 📋 **Overview**

The Tax Law Reasoning Generator is a sophisticated system for creating synthetic tax law cases with AI-enhanced narratives and multi-step reasoning chains. It's designed to evaluate and benchmark AI systems' capabilities in complex legal reasoning tasks based on the MuSR (Multi-step Soft Reasoning) framework.

Client B is married and files jointly with his spouse. They have grown their family to include four dependents, contributing to the bustling and lively atmosphere at their home. \n\nOur secondary subject in this case, Client E, is a 50-year-old individual who also falls in the medium income bracket. Client E is also married, but unlike Client B, chooses to file separately, a decision that may have significant tax implications. The household is slightly quieter with only two dependents under his care.\n\nDuring the tax year under review, Clients B and E jointly held a mortgage on their residence. The accrued mortgage interest for this period amounted to $11,830.53, a substantial figure that could significantly impact their tax situation. \n\nDelving further into Client B's financial circumstances, it is noted that he incurred medical expenses totaling $3,428.94 during the tax year. Medical expenses, as we know, can often be leveraged for tax deductions if they surpass a certain threshold.\n\nFurthermore, Client B was deemed eligible for an earned income credit of $217.02. This federal income tax credit is designed to support low-to-moderate income working individuals and couples, especially those with children.\n\nAdditionally, Client B was granted a child tax credit of $2,000.00 for the tax year. This non-refundable credit is intended to provide an element of financial relief for families as they navigate the expenses associated with raising children.\n\nIn light of this data, our task is to ascertain the appropriate treatment of these financial events within the context of current tax laws, and subsequently, calculate any potential tax liability. As we move forward, we will need to thoroughly examine the intricacies of each individual's tax situation, taking into account their filing status, income level, and the number of dependents they claim. Additionally, we will need to evaluate how the combined mortgage interest and Client B's medical expenses, earned income credit, and child tax credit affect overall tax liability.\n\nThis scenario serves as a compelling study in the complexity of tax law, as it interweaves multiple financial events and personal circumstances.

    "reasoning_chain": [
      "Step 1: Fact Identification Client B and E jointly hold a mortgage on their residence and have accrued mortgage interest of $11,830.53. Client B has incurred medical expenses of $3,428.94. Client B is also eligible for an earned income credit of $217.02 and a child tax credit of $2,000.00. Client B files jointly with his spouse and has four dependents, while Client E files separately and has two dependents.",
      "Step 2: Rule Application Under IRC section 163(h), the mortgage interest can be deducted if the mortgage is a secured debt on a qualified home in which you have an ownership interest. The deduction is generally allowed on up to $1 million of home acquisition debt and up to $100,000 of home equity debt. Regarding medical expenses, according to IRC section 213(a), they are deductible only if they exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI). The earned income credit (EIC) under IRC section 32 and the child tax credit under IRC section 24 are both refundable credits. However, the EIC is subject to income limits and the child tax credit is subject to a phase-out for higher income taxpayers.",
      "Step 3: Calculations To calculate the potential deductions and credits, we first need to determine the AGI for both clients. Without the exact income figures, we cannot calculate the exact amounts. However, we can establish the formulas: Mortgage Interest Deduction = $11,830.53 (assuming the debt is below the limit) Medical Expense Deduction = ($3,428.94 - 7.5% of AGI) if this amount is positive Earned Income Credit = $217.02 (assuming income is below the limit) Child Tax Credit = $2,000.00 (assuming income is below the phase-out limit)",
      "Step 4: Interpretation Since Client B and E jointly hold the mortgage, they would need to decide how to split the mortgage interest deduction. If they split it evenly, each would be able to deduct $5,915.27. Client B's medical expenses would only be deductible if they exceed 7.5% of his AGI. If his AGI is below approximately $45,719, he would be able to deduct some of his medical expenses. The earned income credit and child tax credit are both subject to income limits. If Client B's income is too high, he may not be able to claim these credits.",
      "Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, Client B and E can potentially reduce their tax liability through the mortgage interest deduction, and Client B may also be able to reduce his tax liability through the medical expense deduction and the earned income and child tax credits. However, these deductions and credits are subject to income limits and other restrictions. It would be advisable for both clients to consult with a tax professional to ensure they are maximizing their potential tax savings."

# Error: Template file not found
# Solution: Check file exists or use fallback
try:
    config = config_manager.load_template_config("advanced")
except FileNotFoundError:
    config = GenerationConfig()  # Use defaults
```

**Validation Errors:**

```python
# Check case validity before processing
is_valid, errors = validate_tax_case_detailed(case)
if not is_valid:
    print("Validation errors:", errors)
```


### **Logging Configuration**

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)

# Enable debug logging for detailed information
logging.getLogger('src.tax_law_generator').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## 🎯 **Performance Considerations**

### **Optimization Tips**

1. **Batch Generation**: Use `DatasetGenerator` for efficient bulk processing
2. **AI Caching**: Consider caching AI responses for repeated patterns
3. **Configuration Tuning**: Adjust complexity distribution for performance vs. quality
4. **Template Optimization**: Optimize template files for faster loading

### **Resource Usage**

- **Memory**: ~50MB base + ~10MB per 1000 cases
- **API Calls**: 3-5 OpenAI calls per AI-enhanced case
- **Generation Speed**: ~2-5 seconds per case (with AI), ~0.1 seconds (without AI)
- **Disk Usage**: ~50KB per case (JSON format)

## 🔮 **Extension Points**

### **Adding New AI Providers**

```python
class CustomAIProvider(AIProvider):
    def generate_text(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        # Implement your AI service integration
        pass
    
    def validate_response(self, response: str) -> bool:
        # Implement response validation
        pass
```


### **Custom Evaluation Metrics**

```python
class CustomEvaluator(CaseEvaluator):
    def evaluate_case(self, case: TaxLawCase) -> EvaluationMetrics:
        # Add custom evaluation logic
        metrics = super().evaluate_case(case)
        metrics.custom_score = self._calculate_custom_metric(case)
        return metrics
```


### **New Entity Types**

```python
# Add to entity_templates.json
{
  "nonprofit": {
    "base_attributes": ["mission", "revenue", "tax_exemption"],
    "exemption_templates": {
      "501c3": {
        "characteristics": ["charitable", "tax_exempt"],
        "typical_complications": ["unrelated_business_income"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
